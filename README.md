Did you know that Edison invented the use of the term "bug" to refer to a technical problem? While it is possible that this term for a technical glitch predates Edison's use of it in the mid-1870s, no earlier references to this usage have thus far been found. Edison nicely described his use of the term in a letter of 13 November 1878 to Theodore Puskas, his agent in France:

It has been just so in all of my inventions. The first step is an intuition and comes in a burst— Then difficulties arise. This thing gives out then that. "Bugs" as such little faults and difficulties are called, show themselves— Months of intense watching, study and labor are required before commercial success—or failure—is certainly reached.

That same year there are other references in Edison's correspondence to this use of the term bug. In a 13 March 1878 letter to Western Union President William Orton Edison humorously described a bug in his telephone apparatus:

You were partly correct, I did find a "bug" in my apparatus, but it was not in the telephone proper It was of the genus "callbellum" The insect appears to find conditions for its existence in all call apparatus of Telephones.

And writing to William Preece about his telephone on 19 May 1878 Edison noted, "If the static charge is the bug I will go for a compensation."

It is not entirely clear when Edison began to use this term but it first appears in a notebook entry of 27–28 July 1876 in connection with experiments on his acoustic transfer telegraph, which used time-sharing to transmit multiple messages over a wire. 

Exhibit C is the wire on short ckt the ground wire having been inserted on the multiple forks at both ends thus

Exhibit D shews same with Phila on= These shew where the mysterious bug was: the device for "Earthing" the wire on the low forks was a failure while that on the multiple is a success= Now this explains why all my rinkles failed

A number of notebook entries from the period 1876-78 include Edison's use of this term to refer to a variety of technical problems.

It is likely that Edison had been using the term “bug” for several years. Although it does not appear in the written record before 1876, the first version of what Edison would later call a "bug trap" for his quadruplex telegraph system can be found in a patent caveat that he drew up in early August 1873 that contained the key elements of this system for transmitting four messages simultaneously. Edison's quadruplex combined a diplex circuit (which sent two messages in the same direction) with a standard duplex (which sent two messages in opposite directions) in order to transmit four messages simultaneously over one wire, two in each direction. In late in 1872 and early 1873 Edison had tried to design a diplex by using both reversals of current direction and variations in current strength to send two messages the same way simultaneously on one wire. However, he found that current reversals created false breaks and caused one message to interfere with the other. In his August 1873 caveat, Edison developed a solution for this problem based on an insight he reached while experimenting in England with his automatic telegraph system. Unable to eradicate the disturbance at its source, he found a way to isolate the false breaks electromechanically, thus preventing them from creating interference. Edison would later refer to this solution as a "bug trap" and by the late 1880s this term was being used to describe this key element of his quadruplex system (Electrical World 1888, 290; see also AIEE Proceedings 1909, 1293). 

The bug trap illustrates one of Edison's key inventive strategies. When he could not eliminate the cause of a problem, he sought an arrangement that rendered the effects insignificant. Edison had earlier used this approach while developing improved printing telegraphs where he placed the printing and typewheel magnets in series, with one being made insensitive to the weaker currents that activated the other (see TAEB 1:161, 292). He also used it in an automatic telegraph caveat where an unavoidable current between two receiving pens was made negligible by increasing the separation between the recording pens (Edison Caveat 43).

The first appearance of the term "bug trap" in Edison's notebooks is in connection with his efforts in May 1877 to develop a sextuplex telegraph for transmitting six messages simultaneously, three in each direction. 

The following year he used this term in connection with his telephone experiments. In one case humorously calling it a "Boog Troup."
