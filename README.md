# Earliest Use of the Term "Bug"

Did you know that Edison likely invented the use of the term "bug" to refer to a technical problem? The earliest documented use for the term as a technical glitch is found in the Oxford English Dictionary, which quotes the 15 September 1875 issue of the journal *Operator*, "The biggest ‘bug’ yet has been discovered in the U.S. Hotel Electric Annunciator." However, it is likely that this note came from Edison himself. Edison had been associated with the new journal when it started in 1874 and by August was serving as its science editor.  Although Edison was never credited for the authorship of any articles or notices, draft versions of some items exist and others are derived directly from Edison’s experimental notes and designs. Edison continued to write for the *Operator* through the end of the year, primarily contributing short pieces. It is likely that Edison also prepared short articles and notices reporting on designs of other experimenters. This kind of secondary reporting by Edison continued throughout 1875. For example, on 21 September 1871 Edison told Charles Batchelor to "mail enclosed batch for *Operator*" in response to the editor who had asked him "to send me some 'scientific' for next number."

No other published references have been found from this period until. The next documented use comes in a a technical note by Edison dated 27 or 28 July 1876. The term also appears in other Edison notes from August and September 1876.

# Edison's "Bug Trap"

In a 10 May 1877 note Edison first used the term bug trap for devices designed to prevent current reversals in his quadruplex telegraph and other multiple telegraph designs. However, the earliest version of such a device can be found in a patent caveat from early August 1873. The "bug trap" illustrates one of Edison's key inventive strategies. When he could not eliminate the cause of a problem, he sought an arrangement that rendered the effects insignificant.

# Telephone Bugs

The following year Edison began using this term in connection with his telephone experiments. In a 13 March 1878 letter to Western Union President William Orton Edison wrote:

> You were partly correct, I did find a "bug" in my apparatus, but it was not in the telephone proper It was of the genus "callbellum" The insect appears to find conditions for its existence in all call apparatus of Telephones.

And writing to William Preece about his telephone on 19 May 1878 Edison noted, "If the static charge is the bug I will go for a compensation."

# Bugs in the Receiver

Edison's telephone receiver proved especially susceptible to bugs. As with his quadruplex Edison designed bugs traps or as he described it in one case, a "Boog Troup."

In the fall of 1878, his nephew Charlie Edison became the primary experimenter on the receiver and in one of his note. Exasperated by the failure of the device to work properly, he drew a "double breasted Bug" and wrote a number of humorous references to bugs. 


# Edison's Definition of a Bug

During 1878 Edison periodically referred to the problem of bugs in his correspondence about his work on telegraphs and telephones. But it was in a letter of 13 November 1878 about his work on electric lighting that Edison provided the best description of his use of bug to describe technical problem:

> It has been just so in all of my inventions. The first step is an intuition and comes in a burst— Then difficulties arise. This thing gives out then that. =="Bugs"=={263,343,91,115} as such little faults and difficulties are called, show themselves— Months of intense watching, study and labor are required before commercial success—or failure—is certainly reached.

# A Humorous Reference

That same year there are other references in Edison's correspondence to this use of the term bug. In a 13 March 1878 letter to Western Union President William Orton Edison humorously described a bug in his telephone apparatus:

> You were partly correct, I did find a "bug" in my apparatus, but it was not in the telephone proper It was of the genus "callbellum" The insect appears to find conditions for its existence in all call apparatus of Telephones.

And writing to William Preece about his telephone on 19 May 1878 Edison noted, "If the static charge is the bug I will go for a compensation."

It is not entirely clear when Edison began to use this term but it first appears in a notebook entry of 27–28 July 1876 in connection with experiments on his acoustic transfer telegraph, which used time-sharing to transmit multiple messages over a wire.

# Notebook Entries

A number of notebook entries from the period 1876-78 include Edison's use of this term to refer to a variety of technical problems.

It is likely that Edison had been using the term “bug” for several years. Although it does not appear in the written record before 1876, the first version of what Edison would later call a "bug trap" for his quadruplex telegraph system can be found in a patent caveat that he drew up in early August 1873 that contained the key elements of this system for transmitting four messages simultaneously. Edison's quadruplex combined a diplex circuit (which sent two messages in the same direction) with a standard duplex (which sent two messages in opposite directions) in order to transmit four messages simultaneously over one wire, two in each direction. In late in 1872 and early 1873 Edison had tried to design a diplex by using both reversals of current direction and variations in current strength to send two messages the same way simultaneously on one wire. However, he found that current reversals created false breaks and caused one message to interfere with the other. In his August 1873 caveat, Edison developed a solution for this problem based on an insight he reached while experimenting in England with his automatic telegraph system. Unable to eradicate the disturbance at its source, he found a way to isolate the false breaks electromechanically, thus preventing them from creating interference. Edison would later refer to this solution as a "bug trap" and by the late 1880s this term was being used to describe this key element of his quadruplex system (*Electrical World* 1888, 290; see also [AIEE Proceedings](https://books.google.com/books?id=4eM2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA1293#v=onepage&q&f=false) 1909, 1293).

The bug trap illustrates one of Edison's key inventive strategies. When he could not eliminate the cause of a problem, he sought an arrangement that rendered the effects insignificant. Edison had earlier used this approach while developing improved printing telegraphs where he placed the printing and typewheel magnets in series, with one being made insensitive to the weaker currents that activated the other (see *TAEB* 1:161, 292). He also used it in an automatic telegraph caveat where an unavoidable current between two receiving pens was made negligible by increasing the separation between the recording pens (Edison Caveat 43).

# The "Bug Trap"

.ve-media https://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/iiif/NS7704ZAQ right width=60% seq=3 

The first appearance of the term "bug trap" in Edison's notebooks is in connection with his efforts in May 1877 to develop a sextuplex telegraph for transmitting six messages simultaneously, three in each direction. 

The following year he used this term in connection with his telephone experiments. In one case humorously calling it a "Boog Troup."
