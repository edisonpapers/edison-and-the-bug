# Earliest Use of the Term "Bug"

Did you know that Edison likely invented the use of the term "bug" to refer to a technical problem? The earliest documented use for the term as a technical glitch is found in the Oxford English Dictionary, which quotes the 15 September 1875 issue of the journal *Operator*, "The biggest ‘bug’ yet has been discovered in the U.S. Hotel Electric Annunciator." However, it is likely that this note came from Edison himself. Edison had been associated with the new journal when it started in 1874 and by August was serving as its science editor.  Although Edison was never credited for the authorship of any articles or notices, draft versions of some items exist and others are derived directly from Edison’s experimental notes and designs. Edison continued to write for the *Operator* through the end of the year, primarily contributing short pieces. It is likely that Edison also prepared short articles and notices reporting on designs of other experimenters. This kind of secondary reporting by Edison continued throughout 1875. For example, on 21 September 1871 Edison told Charles Batchelor to "mail enclosed batch for *Operator*" in response to the editor who had asked him "to send me some 'scientific' for next number."

No other published references have been found from this period until. The next documented use comes in a a technical note by Edison dated 27 or 28 July 1876. The term also appears in other Edison notes from August and September 1876.

# Edison's "Bug Trap"

In a 10 May 1877 note Edison first used the term bug trap for devices designed to prevent current reversals in his quadruplex telegraph and other multiple telegraph designs. However, the earliest version of such a device can be found in a patent caveat from early August 1873. The "bug trap" illustrates one of Edison's key inventive strategies. When he could not eliminate the cause of a problem, he sought an arrangement that rendered the effects insignificant.

# Telephone Bugs

The following year Edison began using this term in connection with his telephone experiments. In a 13 March 1878 letter to Western Union President William Orton Edison wrote:

> You were partly correct, I did find a "bug" in my apparatus, but it was not in the telephone proper It was of the genus "callbellum" The insect appears to find conditions for its existence in all call apparatus of Telephones.

And writing to William Preece about his telephone on 19 May 1878 Edison noted, "If the static charge is the bug I will go for a compensation."

# Bugs in the Receiver

Edison's telephone receiver proved especially susceptible to bugs. As with his quadruplex Edison designed bugs traps or as he described it in one case, a "Boog Troup." 

In the fall of 1878, his nephew Charles Edison, became the primary experimenter on the receiver and the first person in the laboratory other than Edison to use the term in a notebook entry. Exasperated by the failure of the device to work properly, he drew a "double breasted Bug" and wrote a number of humorous references to bugs.

# Edison's Definition of a Bug

In the fall of 1878, Edison began working on electric lighting and in a letter of 13 November 1878 about this work he provided the best description of his use of bug to describe technical problems:

> It has been just so in all of my inventions. The first step is an intuition and comes in a burst— Then difficulties arise. This thing gives out then that. =="Bugs"=={263,343,91,115} as such little faults and difficulties are called, show themselves— Months of intense watching, study and labor are required before commercial success—or failure—is certainly reached.

# The Term Spreads in the Edison Organization

Some of Edison’s associates began to adopt the term in connection with his work on electric lighting. In a 3 November 1878 letter to Edison, his friend George Barker, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, complained about Edison’s delay in providing him with one of his new lamps for a lecture, asking Edison, "Have you found a 'bug' in the light, which is the reason why you don’t want me to show it?"

Commercial lamp production, which began in the fall of 1880, was particularly susceptible to bugs. In April 1881, Francis Upton wrote from the lamp factory, "scarcely a day passes without a new 'bug' showing itself." Problems at the lamp factory sometimes required Edison's attention. For example, in February 1882 Edison's secretary Samuel Insull reported that he had been at the factory "a great deal of late & told me a few minutes ago that he thinks he has struck the radical bug in the lamp." In Paris, where Charles Batchelor had established a European lamp factory, bugs also appeared. For example, in July 1882 he told Edison, "I have struck a 'bug' which I am sure is in the glass." Charles Clarke, chief engineer of Edison Electric, warned Edison of a "big bug in Bergmann's brass mounted sockets" that was creating a short circuit. 

Other bugs appeared when Edison's new elecrical system was exhibited in Paris and London. In November 1881, when Edward Johnson was setting up Edison's exhibit at the Crystal Palace Exhibition in London, he planned to improve on the record of Edison's earlier exhibit at the Paris Electrical Exhibition explaining that, "The one thing which Paris failed most conspicuously in was 'Reliability' I am therefore 'going for' that 'Bug' more particularly than any other—though there are others almost as important". In response to Johnson's letter, Edison advised him that:

> The Belts are liable to slip so you want to look out that all your belts are tight as this is a bad bug when running the machines in multiple arc as if some of the belts are loose the other machines will do all the work and it will be like putting 100 lights on a machine.

Problems also arose at the Pearl Street Station. Soon after it opened in September 1882, Edison had to redesign the coupling for his Jumbo dynamos so that the steam engines that ran them worked together. In his report to Charles Batchelor who was managing the Edison lighting business in Paris, Samuel Insull reported, "Now this bug has been eradicated it would appear that the central station machines will work perfectly." As Edison began installing new stations in 1883, bugs also appeared. Writing from the first of these new stations in Sunbury, PA, William Andrews wrote Edison about "a bug in the dynamo connections" and sent Edison a plan of a new way of connecting spare dynamo, asking him "Please look them over and see if you can find a bug in them."
